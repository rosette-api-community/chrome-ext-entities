#chrome-ext-Entities

**Chrome extension utilizing the Rosette API to extract entities from entire webpage or selected text.**

##Installation

Check out this repo to your machine.

Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live (the directory into which you've cloned this git repo), and select it.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.

##How to Use

Click on the Rosette icon in your Chrome extensions bar at the top right. Click `Enter API Key` to enter your Rosette API Key and save it.

Make sure the extension is enabled, and go to any site (like a news site) with entities and see the entities and category populate.

###About this extension

The Rosette Entity Extraction Chrome extension is part of a series of Chrome extensions designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Rosette API by Basis Technology. All extensions require a Rosette API Key to function in Chrome. If you don't have one, you can get one [here](https://developer.rosette.com/signup). The Entity Extraction extension's sister extensions are the Rosette Name Translation and Rosette Sentiment Analysis extensions. Check them out in their Github repos.

The Entity Extraction extension has two main functions. Given some text - either user-selected or, by default, a full webpage - it will pull out and display all the entities it can find in that text. Entities include People, Locations, and Organizations. This extension will also categorize the text it is given. Some example categories are Arts & Entertainment, Travel, and Science (you can view the full list of  Tier 1 contextual categories defined by the IAB Quality Assurance Guidelines (QAG) Taxonomy [here](http://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-quality-assurance-guidelines-qag-taxonomy/)).

###Why isn't this extension working?

This extension is a demo. As such, there are several reasons why it may not work, or at least may appear not to work. Here are some common ones.

* Rosette Entity Extraction was trained on news articles -- try webpages with larger chunks of text to get better entity results.

* Incorrect Rosette Developer Key stored in the extension. If you haven't entered a key in the "Enter API Key" part of the popup, the extension will probably ask you for one. However, if you enter an invalid key (or even hit "Save" while the key field is empty), the extension will not tell you what's wrong. Try entering your key again. Beware, the key is deleted from local storage when the extension is removed from Chrome.

* A particular website doesn't like being crawled by bots. The combination of page-reading JavaScript with the Rosette API can look like a bot to some pages, so that website may refuse to be read as whole page. Sometimes it will work if you highlight text in the page.

* If it doesn't look like it's working, try refreshing the page or clicking on the extension again. It may sometimes come up with different results.

Best of luck! Enjoy this taste of the Rosette API!
